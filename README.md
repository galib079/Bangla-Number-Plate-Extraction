# Bangla Number Plate Extraction with YOLOv8

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for training and deploying a YOLOv8-based model for Bangla Number Plate Extraction. With a dataset of 2000 annotated images for training and validation, the model is designed to accurately and efficiently detect and extract Bangla number plates from images.

## Features
- **YOLOv8 Architecture:** Utilizes the YOLOv8 architecture, known for its real-time object detection capabilities.
- **Bangla Number Plate Detection:** Specifically trained to recognize and extract Bangla number plates.
- **2000 Image Dataset:** Trained and validated on a diverse dataset of 2000 images to ensure robust performance.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Includes scripts and tools for easy training, testing, and deployment.
